The trend toward interconnection and distribution has, in mainstream computer science, 
long been recognized as a key challenge, and much of the intellectual energy of the field
throught the last three decades has been directed toward developing software tools and
mechanisms that allow us to build distributed systems with greater ease and reliability.

It may well be that, indeed, it is likely, that these interests are not the same. It becomes 
necessary to endow such systems with the ability to cooperate and reach agreements with
others in everyday life.

Together, these trends have led to the emergence of a new field in Computer Science: Multiagent Systems.
